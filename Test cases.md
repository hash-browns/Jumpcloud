Is this a calculation of requests to create hashes or all requests to /hash?              |
| Does a GET request to /stats return the average time in miliseconds ?                         | No, not sure how this is being computed but I'm seeing the average a lot higher than I would expect. If I make 1 request to /hash it takes about 5 seconds but the average in /stats is ~250 seconds | Part of acceptance criteria. Number seemed high given the speed of the responses.                                                                                      |
| Can I make a GET request to /stats when no hash requests have been made?                      | Yes, just returns 0 TotalRequest and 0 averageTime                                                                                                                                                   | Curious if it would come back null or return an error                                                                                                                  |
